<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>r.parflow.subsurfacedepth</em> This tool provides subsurface depth estimation and creates the bottom boundary of ParFlow computational domain based on terrain elevations and slopes. These methods allow reducing the number of active cells in regions with large subsurface thicknesses that normally appear in the orthogonal grid format with flat bottom boundary. Thus, it is possible to obtain less subsurface thickness at the tops of hills or in more inclined regions and greater subsurface thickness in the lower regions of the topography and in the bottoms of valleys.
